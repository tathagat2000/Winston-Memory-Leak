This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
This Repo is made to test our hypothesis that when creating multiple winston loggers, if we use the same transport instances then it causes a memory leak.
